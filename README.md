# QA Wizeline certificate Assessment 1

_Session 1 assessment: Challenge Exercises (TestCafe)_


### Installation 🔧

We need to install the dependencies using node.js and npm

```
npm install
```

## Run assessment ⚙️

Once installed, we can use the following custom command to execute Test Cafe using chrome:
```
npm run test-chrome
```
## About .env ⚙️

Due to the USER and PASSWORD being public, the .env is not ignored by github thus making it easier to test.
You can change the user at the .env file to test for different ones.

:warning: Make sure any change to this file is not pushed to the remote.
